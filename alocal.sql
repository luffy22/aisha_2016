(1, 80, 'Surya', 'surya', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sun popularly known as Surya in Vedic Astrology is the king of all planets. It is the karaka for soul which is considered a part of God or God itselt. Not only that Surya is responsible for health, fame and leadership roles. Surya is also a karaka for father. Our eyes which let us see this beautiful world are governed by Surya as well. It is a male planet, royalty in nature and is given the title of King among planets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Surya is the king and leadership skills come naturally to those with good placement for Surya, ideally the <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19:karma-bhava&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119" title="10th house link">10th house</a>. Many great politicians and leaders have Surya in an important placement in the horoscope. People with positive Surya in a horoscope show poise, confidence and firm determination. They rise to the status of a leader and an able administrator. People with a good Surya can be quite successful in the areas of agriculture and administration. Goverment jobs which provide a sense of security and stability are very likely due to a good Surya in a horoscope. Even if Surya is in <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=28:libra&amp;catid=12:12-rashis&amp;Itemid=148" title="tula rashi article link">tula rashi</a> which is its neecha rashi, provided it causes a neecha bhanga you are sure to see the concerned individual in a very important administrative or political role. Bear in mind they rarely get the top position if Surya is indeed in tula rashi but 2nd best isn''t always so bad. Health, Vigour and Vitality all improve if Surya is in a good placement in a horoscope. With <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:budh&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118" title="budh planet link">Budh</a> as a co-tenant in a good sign or house, a very powerful yoga called Budh-Aditya Yoga is formed. It provides wealth, fame and prosperity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There are downsides to any planet and Surya is no different. While a positive surya is a boon for individuals it is a curse for those around him. Surya is arrogant and inconsiderate to other people''s needs. In popular stories Surya is the father and <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118" title="shani article link">Shani</a> is the son yet they both don''t get along well. This is partly down to the autocratic and dictatorial nature of Surya the father and unapologetic and rigid nature of Shani the son. Families where father and children don''t get along well are sure to have Surya-Shani relationship in one way or the other. Surya influenced people generally get high positions and they are sure to push everyone to work beyond their possible limit which maybe fortunate for the enterprises but not so fortunate for the employees. Well surely they don''t become Mr. Popular with the minions yet they are sure to get special accolades from their bosses. In terms of health a bad placement of Surya is sure to give you several ailments, weak body and low confidence but a strong placement gives over-confidence in ones abilities and ultimately that causes their downfall. Burns and Boils also happen if Surya is in a fiery sign.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The problem with people who have a good Surya is they act confident and ambitious and shine a little too much for others to feel jealousy and insecurity. People often confuse their confidence for arrogance and their ambitions for egocentric behavior. They do not help their own cause either by being insensitive to those less confident and successful souls. &nbsp;Not everyone can become successful in life cause if everyone becomes a king then who would be the subjects? This trivial matter is too hard for people with good placement of Surya to understand. While the benefits of a good Surya are great as it gives authority, fame and health one must care not to be over-confident and forget kindness and empathy.</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:43:52', 899, '', '2014-09-06 10:46:02', 140, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:43:52', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 21, 9, 'surya in astrology, surya in vedic astrology, surya in 12 rashi, surya in 12 bhava, sun in astrology, sun in vedic astrology', 'Surya in Vedic Astrology', 1, 173, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

It is a karaka for mind and everything related to it. Moon also affects the blood circulation as well as water portions on the body and on earth. Well that implies nearly 70% of body and of earth are affected by Chandra. Chandra maybe a small planet and it only stays in a rashi for 2.5 days but its implications are huge when you take the co-tenants, rashi and house lords into consideration. Chandra brings tides and ebbs in an ocean and similarly it brings tides and ebbs in a human mind also. Every positive or negative, good or evil, happy or sad, nice or bad thought that comes to an individual is thanks to chandra and associations and afflictions to chandra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moon is the closest planet to the earth. Theoretically it is a satellite. Just like satellites are responsible for good and bad signals in a television; Chandra is responsible for good and bad thoughts in an individual. <a title="shani article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Shani</a> and <a title="rahu article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Rahu</a> association with Chandra is a prime factor for people with weak or malefic thought process.

Though bear in mind it is not always the case.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is highly impressionable graha. It quickly takes in the qualities of its rashi, co-tenants and grahas which aspect it.&nbsp;Lets talk in more detail about Chandra and associations with other planets.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Surya is called as Amavasya or No Moon. Many astrologers and jyotishis push the panic button once they hear of this scenario. Various havans, poojas and rings are provided to calm these so called horrible scenario. Well the truth couldn''t be farther off. Well Surya is soul and Chandra is the mind and it wouldn''t be so bad if soul and mind become one considering that soul is considered part of god and mind is the most definiting part in an invidual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Mangal is considered auspicious by many astrologers cause it gives abundant wealth. That is partly true but they forget to mention that this association gives rise to a wounded warrior who is always there to take revenge on others.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Budh is probably among the worst. Most mental disorders are caused by this association. Chandra controls the mind while Budh takes care of nervous system. Not to mention this association causes an individual to be a chatter box.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association to Guru is probably the best. In a favourable rashi it causes a powerful yoga called Gaja Kesari yoga. It gives abundant wealth, happiness and prosperity.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with <a title="shukra article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Shukra</a> is also good. It provides abundant love. Most of the romeo-juliet stories are thanks to Chandra-Shukra association. The fairest and most beautiful looking individuals both male and female are very likely to have assocation of Chandra with Shukra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Shani causes <a title="vish yoga link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74:visha-yoga&amp;catid=14:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=165">Vish Yoga</a>. The mind is constantly in thinking process and nothing comes out of tireless thinking but sadness and worries. Depression is one of the possible scenarious with Shani-Chandra association. But people who learn to control their emotions and adapt to difficulties and changing scenarios become great individuals but that doesn''t come without a struggle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra with Rahu is bad in general terms. Rahu is cloudy and smokey and causes disruption to natural though process. Simply speaking this association clouds judgement of an individual.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra''s association with Ketu is bad for some and good for some. Ketu is the planet of detachment. Well for those who want to get closer to the god; this placement provides the right tools of obtaining that goal. For those who are too caught up with materialistic success; consider this placement to be quite a bother and probably arrange for some counter measures.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Chandra is very small but its implications on human beings are pretty big. It alone is a gentle, calm and caring graha but depending on rashi lordship or co-tenants it could bring peace or havoc in your life. The greatest enemy or friend of an individual is not anyone but his mind and thoughts. Once you control your own mind; controlling this world is not that difficult.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:44:20', 899, '', '2014-04-09 05:59:33', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:44:20', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 13, 8, 'chandra in vedic astrology, chandra in astrology, chandra in 12 bhava, chandra in 12 rashi', 'chandra in vedic astrology', 1, 217, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

No one is bothered to know that the very word "Mangal" means good and auspicious. Ofcourse mars is a fiery planet and has his sort of problems associated with itself but it is better to understand why this fiery planet is so angry and cold before making any judgement on people who are influenced very highly by this planet.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal is considered a male planet. To be more precise people born under the infuence of mars are the macho types. These includes females also. The ladies who like to order, shout and get angry to get things done are mostly under the influence of a strong Mangal in horoscope. Mars has a lot of high octane energy. People under the influence of Mars keep on doing relentless work, want everything on time, get angry at smallest inaccuracies of co-workers or employees and worst of all keep others on their toes. Mangal hates laziness and lies. These are the reasons why they are the ideal employees but not-so great employers. Mangal is least likely to cause downfall of others. They may get angry, make enemies, use harsh speech but they rarely ever keep enemity for lives. They may get angry very fast but their anger also calms down after some time. But none the less Mangal does have its share of handicaps.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; Mangal is impatient and very harsh in speech. People under influence of Mars often make rash decisions and make enemies out of people due to their high moral values and principles. The world is not so honest and sincere. It is full of scums and leeches who thrive on looting and cheating others. Since Mangal cannot stand these things he is always at logger-heads with these people. A bride or groom who has Mangal in a prominent position cannot compromise on his/her ideals and principles. That is why a lot of quarrels happen and eventually divorces happen. Ofcourse astrologers do not help the cause by matching partners with Mars or Shani&nbsp;in a prominent position of the partner.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; None the less Mangal does have its good side. Mangala influenced people easily sacrifice their own goodwill for people for whom they care. They would give up their profit for others to avoid loss. If any sort of association with <a title="guru article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Guru</a> is present they could even bear loss if those they care for are profited from their sacrifice.&nbsp;Most of the prominent actors, sportsperson, celebrities and good army commanders have Mangal in a very good position. Mars influence people do great in places where everything needs to be done on time like railways and armies. They make very competent lawyers and deal makers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; In my view some people are born for the benefit of the community. They are there to make a difference. Mars influenced people are one of them. They may not be the most charming people to stay around but they are the most trustworthy, hard working and kind hearted people to be friends with.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:45:23', 899, '', '2014-04-09 06:00:55', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:45:23', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 13, 7, 'mangal in vedic astrology, mangal in 12 rashi, mangal in 12 bhava, mangal dosha, mangal in astrology, mars in astrology', 'mangal in vedic astrology', 1, 177, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(4, 86, 'Budh', 'budh', '<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Mercury known as Budh in Vedic Astrology is the prince among planets. Budh is young, talkative and smart. Budh is generally very close to <a title="surya article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1:surya&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Surya</a> in a horoscope with maximum distance being 28 degrees from each other. Budh provides common sense, speech, communicative skills and also commands the neural processes in the brain. Budh and <a title="guru article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Guru</a> are almost identical in that both are scholars but in present scenarios the smart and argumentative Budh wins over the knowledgable but dignified Guru. Budh takes the qualities of its co-tenants easily be it good or bad. It is a very impressionable graha. Though Budh doesn''t see most planets as enemies other then <a title="chandra article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Chandra</a>, many see him as their enemy.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this age of PR those who can market themselves get more brownie points over others. Thanks to Budh you can effectively communicate your point across to others be it via speech or via writing. Most of the scientific research and innovations are possible due to the ideas and itellact provided by Budh. Be warned that plain old Budh is nothing but sweet talk. It needs a driver to put argument into efforts and theories into practise. Grahas like <a title="Mangal Article Link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Mangal</a>, <a title="Shani Article Link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Shani</a> and Surya''s association with Budh are the drivers behind most important inventions. Budh is a businessman or more precisely a sales man. He can sweet talk anybody into buying a product be it good or bad. Most effecient salesman, call centre operatives, shop keepers and marketers need a good Budh for success in their fields. Those who have a weak Budh may suffer from speech defects, bad communicative skills as well as mental disorders.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is a very impressionable graha. Like Chandra it takes the qualities of its rashi, house and co-tenants very easily. A plain old Budh rarely makes or breaks a person. With planet Surya as its co-tenant a very powerful yoga is formed known as Budh-Aditya yoga which provides knowledge, wealth and heppiness. Though not everyone gets the benefit of Budh-Aditya yoga. Association of Budh+Mangal is difficult to judge. Sometimes this association causes catostrophe because Budh is calm while Mangal is restless. Two opposing forces staying in a rashi would provide disaster. But there are times when Budh provides direction to the abundant energy of Mangal. Many great individuals have a favorable association of Budh+Mangal. Many successful lawyers have Budh+Mangal relationship in their horoscope. Budh+Guru is a favorable association by and large. Guru''s knowledge is supported by Budh''s analytical, communicative and argumentative skills. In not so favourable location you could see a thug who uses his knowledge and speech to cheat others. Either way you are guaranteed to see a smart and successful individual when Budh+Guru is there in a horoscope. Budh+<a title="shukra article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=6:shukra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Shukra</a> is also a very good combination. Musicians and Artists are likely to have association of Mangal+Budh. Budh+Shani provides good Mathematicians and Chartered Accountants.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Budh is royalty by nature and more importantly royalty without duties. So you can''t expect Budh to understand problems or do proactive work or go out of his way to help others. Budh articulate and refined speech are sure to win over a few people, but long term they are bound to see that he is nothing but trash talk. Budh''s association with Mangal, Shani or Surya in a favorable location provides great results for individual as well as the community.</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:46:04', 899, '', '2014-04-09 06:01:46', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:46:04', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 10, 6, 'budh in vedic astrology, budh in astrology, budh in 12 bhava, budh in 12 rashi, mercury in vedic astrology, mercury in astrology', 'budh in vedic astrology', 1, 165, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

A well placed guru in a horoscope suggests a successful and happy life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jupiter is one planet which alone in a good position can liberate from all other negative influence of planets. It gives a positive outlook in life, gives a calm personality and pleasing appearance. A strong guru signifies a person who is learned, smart, calm and dignified. Guru gives a firm and unwavering faith in god and provides knowledge of Truth. Knowledge alone can free a soul from the worldy chains that plague the human soul and takes the soul closer to its maker aka The God.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Guru maybe the most benefic planet in a horoscope but it does have its share of negative influence like any other planet. People with Guru in a prominent position often are a bit chubby. Guru promotes well being but unfortunately it promotes laziness and gluttony also. Guru cause a person to be fat, chubby and easy going.

People with a strong guru are kind in nature and wonderful friends and family members. They easily get help from all spheres of life.

All the romance in the world is a gift from Shukra. The beautiful women, melodious music and mesmerizing dance moves are all thanks to the great planet called Shukra. The life force or semen which brings another life on this earth is also governed by Shukra. All the sexual organs which provide pleasures are governed by Shukra. The delicacies like Chocolate and Pastries derive their sweetness from Shukra as Shukra is the karaka for Sweetness. The people with a great disposition of Shukra are attractive, wealthy, fashionable and charming. They are admirers of art, music, fashion and beauty.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While Shukra is a karaka for everything beautiful and gorgeous it does have its downsides.

When there is Rahu involved with Shukra marriage may even be with the wrong person and leads to bad reputation for the individual and their close relatives. Shukra causes drug, alcohol and sex addiction. Even addiction to medicines and prescribed drugs is possible with bad placement of Shukra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said that it does do wonderful with <a title="chandra article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Chandra</a> as co-tenant.

Shukra also gives love for animals and provides benefits through them in a favourable placement.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Most of the beautiful women and fortunate men have Shukra in a very good disposition. All the famous celebrities have a good Shukra or a favourable period of good Shukra. While Guru may give wealth, happiness and knowledge to a native leave it to Shukra to give you the finer things in life. Shukra natives are like a horse wihout a lease which can run off anywhere he/she pleases. The kind of ecstacy, pleasures and forbidden desires which Shukra provides can only be dreamt by other planets. Fame and fortune is abundant for people with a good Shukra.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ofcourse with no boundary between acceptance and taboo most of the Shukra influenced people go bonkers after a certain time start resorting to drugs or even medicines to calm their mind. Romance and Sensual pleasures could be over the top but so is the risk of catching a venereal disease. Love takes a backseat and lust would control your mind and body unless there is a limiting aspect of Guru or Shani involved. The price of being a celebrityy is high with no privacy or peace but those who only crave for Page 3 lifestyle should start pleasing dear sweet aunty known as Shukra.

(7, 92, 'Shani', 'shani', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The word Shani seems to invoke fear in the hearts of people like no other planet. Shani represents scarcity, fear, oppression, old age and poverty. Well that alone seems to put this humble planet in the category of worst of the worst. By all means Shani can be said to be a malefic planet who brings adversities and havoc in our lives but the perspective has to change regarding how we look at adversities to understand the working of Shani a little more.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Let me start by saying that Shani is appointed as a judge by&nbsp;Lord Shiva himself. A normal judiciary functions according to laws of the country and Shani functions according to divine laws of the nature. Shani is aware of most of our karmas and he provides punishments befitting our crimes. Most of the human beings are far from noble souls. We lie, steal, ridicule others and even deceive or backstab others. This is not limited to one birth time but continues over several births and rebirths. Though we may not be aware of these crimes, gramps Shani keeps a watchful eye over these karmas. Remember, he cannot punish you unless you have done some crime. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why the fear of gramps Shani? Well, we are human beings after all. We cannot fathom why we need patience, hard work and discipline while the other guy gets the ferraris, the beautiful mansions and the iPhones. The sooner we learn the need for discipline, hard work, patience, fortitude and empathy the sooner does gramps Shani move out of our way. He does give wonderful results to those who plan the long road to success with honest and sincere efforts and plan betterment of the community and world. But those good fruits take a long, long time to come. By that time your patience is tested to the limits and your ego and arrogance are washed away. You are new and renewed all dignified, kind and considerate to your fellow beings. &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So is gramps Shani good or bad? Well he is bad cause we often plan shortcuts in life and easy way out of misery and suffering. That is the sole reason why Shani makes our lives a miserable hell. Say you are a prisoner in a jail and the warden catches you &nbsp;trying to sneak out of jail before your sentence is over. Most of us would assume that the warden would be very upset and may sentence us to more severe punishment. Same thing applies to Shani but he actually cares for his prisoners and wants them to be contributing members of the society. We do not like Shani cause he is a strict teacher who likes to whip now and then to teach some discipline and hard work to his students. No one likes to learn things the hard way so to speak.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Having said all this Shani has positive aspects in life also. Most of the guys who grow from rags to riches have Shani in an important disposition in their horoscope. Most of the people who make a difference in lives of others have Shani in exalted or own sign or in a good position. Shani destroys everything that is not sustainable over a long period of time. That includes relationships. Most of the divorces happen during the Saade-Saati or Shani Periods. Though it may seem like hell at that time after some time we come to realise that the relationship couldn''t have worked out and what happened was for the better. Our ego is destroyed and we learn the importance of patience and dignity. At the end of saade-saati most people develop a positive outlook towards lives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the end of the day it all comes down to perspective. A simple, easy-going life is a choice of most but attainable by few. Those who believe in making lemonade, when lemons are provided fare much better in life then those who cry while looking at the lemons. Success is not defined by how high a person rises but how many times a person gets up after falling.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:47:34', 899, '', '2014-04-17 07:54:25', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:47:34', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 10, 3, 'shani in vedic astrology, shani in astrology, saade-saati, shani and superstition', 'shani in vedic astrology', 1, 185, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

It is also termed as a dragon''s head in some places while in vedic astrology Rahu has the head of a snake. According to vedic astrology, Rahu is responsible for causing eclipse to Surya and Chandra. Rahu is &nbsp;smokey and mysterious. He represents black arts, magic, taboo activities and foreigners. Rahu is an impersonator who tries to show the qualities he does not have. He is considered a malefic planet and astrologers make quite a fortune out of the so-called bad yogas associated with it. Well, the truth couldn''t be further off.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rahu is a planet in vedic astrology and like in all planet''s case certain rules and regulations apply. The placement of Rahu at time of birth is fixed according to previous life karmas. Rahu is the most accurate measure to judge the sins of previous life karmas depending on his placement in horoscope along with its drishti. Rahu carries the mandate of putting a human being under illusion. Rahu encourages individuals to take risky and foolish decisions which only bring harm and loss for him. Ofcourse, sometimes it gives quite favorable results for people interested in forbidden desires and&nbsp;taboo activites. Not only that money, power, sex and fame are also abundant in a favorable period of Rahu.&nbsp;Most politicians have a very good Rahu. Rahu is a karaka for foreigners and everything mysterious. Rahu is one of the planets which in a favorable position can suggest a successful chance of going and settling abroad.

It is generally favorable if Rahu is alone in a house with no co-tenants and not casting drishti on any planet. Rahu causes eclipse to the Sun and the Moon. In other words the intelligence and rational thinking are hindered due to Rahu. Bad decisions, tough luck and mental problems follow. The individuals who have Surya+Rahu or Chandra+Rahu in the same house are better off when they consult others for major decisions in their lives.

It is a malefic planet but that does mean it is literally bad. The facts about Ketu are often misinterpreted to suit the worldy desires so much so that it has lost its divine purpose. Ketu is capable of taking an individual closer to moksha. Only <a title="guru article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Guru</a> is the other planet which can boasts of this great feat. The final purpose of all living beings is to get closer to the Supreme Entity aka God.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So why the unnecessary prejudice towards Ketu? Well the fact that Ketu has its own agenda which is free from the social norms, rules and regulations makes it quite a villian for the society. The world is not known to welcome people who go against social norms. Most of people with Ketu in lagna or with <a title="chandra articlel link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Chandra</a> in horoscope are detached from others and live a solitary life. They have a nihilistic, uncaring and unapologetic attitude towards society as a whole. They are meant to break away from the social bonds which bind the individuals to society. Some of them even resort to total reclusiveness from society in the form of Sanyas. Others less fortunate try to live a detached life while remaining in the society constantly at logger-heads with the cultural norms.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lets talk of the downside of Ketu in a bad placement for a bit. Ketu is the astrological equivalent word of detachment. Divorces, Separation from loved ones and Solitary Life would send quivers down anyone''s spine. As long as you live in this world ones self is bound to have inclinations towards socialisation, recognition, acceptence, affection and attraction. It is only natural to have these feelings. The greatest of the saints and holy souls desired for such comforts and pleasures. Now the person who lived in solitary confinement and emotional reclusiveness cannot just mix with the society like sugar in water. They would always stick out like a sore thumb. Eventually their desires fade away and they become even more reclusive and paranoid of the society. They loose purpose and motivation in their life. But fear not as Krishna said in the Gita:</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: left;">"<em>One who walks on path towards knowledge and engages in auspicious activities does not meet his end.</em>" --Bhagvad Gita Chapter 6 Verse 40</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The essence here is person with a good Ketu is naturally detached and not interested in materialistic goals and social confirmity. That alone brings them closer to the Supreme Entity which is the final goal of all human beings. For them their own inner voice is final take on everything. As long as you don''t care about society it would be the highest blessing to have Ketu in lagna or with Chandra or have period of Ketu which brings separation from loved ones. For others who are bonded with society there is a solution to pray to Lord Ganesh to lessen the effects of a malefic Ketu.</p>\r\n<p><span style="color: #000000;">&nbsp;</span></p>', '', 1, 10, '2014-02-01 11:48:24', 899, '', '2014-04-09 06:06:20', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-01 11:48:24', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 9, 1, 'ketu in vedic astrology, ketu in astrology, ketu in 12 bhavas, ketu in 12 rashi', 'ketu in vedic astrology', 1, 276, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

It is used to know about physical appearance, skin color, body constitution, personality and intelligence of the person. In simpler terms the First House in a horoscope is the mirror to the individual whose horoscope is shown. The important thing to know is only a summary is possible through First House. The whole thesis of an individual requires lots of careful study of various factors including Chandra Lagna, Surya Lagna, Nakshatra Lords of Lagna and Chandra and last by not least the Lagnesha.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; 1st house is part of <a title="vishnu sthana links" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=86:vishnu&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">Vishnu Sthanas</a> as well as trine called <a title="laxmi sthana links" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85:laxmi&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">Laxmi Sthanas</a>. The physical attributes and complexion of individuals are based on rashi in lagna, lagnesha and also the nakshatra lords of lagna and lagnesha. The emotional characteristics of individual can be more accurately predicted using lagna, lagnesha and Chandra''s placement in horoscope and nakshatra lord of <a title="chandra article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Chandra</a>.

Emotional picture of individual is better estimated from Chandra Lagna. Same way Surya Lagna is used to decipher the spiritual view of things.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Each lagna/first house has a planetary lord which is known as lagnesha. The placement of lagnesha is also very important to be considered when talking about charecteristics, health, emotions and physical attributes. A troubled placement of lagnesha suggests a troubled individual while a favourable placement of lagnesha suggests success and happiness for individual. Whatever the result one could find his true self through First House and Lagnesha. The rashi charecteristics are also absorbed by First House.

His complexion is generally fairer compared to those around him.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; If you ever find the need to discover youself using astrology then first house is a nice place to start. It provides a brief overview of you as a person. If you carefully study First House including Chandra Lagna, Surya Lagna, Nakshatra Lord of Lagna and Lagnesha as well as Rashi in First House you could solve the big jigsaw puzzle that is your characture and nature.

It causes tremendous transformation in lives of an individual which is generally not welcomed and regarded as adversity. People who get too comfortable in life with pace of life and surroundings find it difficult when faced with huge transformation both physical and mental required by 8th house. Of course 8th house just carries the mandate of karma which would lead the individual to a higher path. At the end of the day it is all a matter of perspective. Some consider transformation as painful while others consider it a blessing in disguise. According to a famous proverb- "One person''s funeral is another person''s bread". Counselors, Therapists, Lawyers, Escorts, Tax Department and Astrologers thrive on the 8th house and problems it creates.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;8th house is the house of death. When, Where and How is the person likely to die can be known through 8th house and factors which affect the 8th house. While worrying about death is unadvised, one should avoid accidents or mishaps by carefully studying 8th house which can accurately describe adversities before they happen. 8th house also deals with inherited wealth and hidden fortune. If you are left with a huge fortune by your forefathers or just found a pot of gold while accidentally digging your house you could be rest assured there is a favorable 8th house.

Believers and Non-Believers both like to argue endlessly over the benefits and flaws of astrology. Believers often say how future can be predicted from the stars and constellations and how one can benefit from knowing the future. Non-Believers would often quarrel how a man is the architect of his own fortune and stars, planets and constellations have no part in deciding fate of the man.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which of them stands right? I would say both of them are right in a way. A logical person will know that a person born in an under-developed country and working in a blue collar job cannot influence the thoughts and actions of whole world as say a person who is born in US and who is part of a political system in there. So isn''t it right to say that stars did favor the one born in US.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But then again if everything was decided by stars and planets there would be no place for hard work and perseverance. There would be no Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Gandhi or Thomas Edison. Hard Work, Dedication, Perseverance, Dignity, Discipline, Diligence and Patience are key factors found in most successful men and women.</p>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify; color: black;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; So which one is it? The answer would be a mixture of both. Astrology is a science of predicting future events based on mathematical and astronomical calculations but that alone is not enough. Hard Work and Sincere Efforts also play a major role in deciding success or failure for an individual. This site would hopefully shed some light on the comman misconcepts and illusions regarding astrology.

Materialistic Pleasures in life have taken precedence over the basic necessities of life like health. Even if you get all the money in life it doesn''t have the power to cheer you up if you have an upset stomach or high fever. Yet most of us run after wealth and discard health. In a way sickness is a reminder by the body to a person that I am present and I need care and attention.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; From an astrological perspective the 1st house and lord of 1st house (Lagnesha or Ascendant) is responsible for the physical build and mental thought process. Diseases and Vitality are governed by 6th house and 8th house respectively. It is interesting to note that 6th house also governs Debt and Enemies while 8th house governs Death. A sick man cannot fight Debts or Enemies neither can he escape Death. While a person''s physique and mental balance is down to destiny or past karma his health is in his own hands. A person can know about his physical and mental capabilities and diseases that occur frequently through the 1st House. Say there is Windy Sign (Mithuna, Tula, or Kumbha) as Ascendant or Lagna and Shani in 1st House (Lagna) then person is likely to have frequent case of flatulence in stomach and a personality which is easily tensed. A fiery sign (Mesha, Simha or Dhana) along with a fiery planet (Mangal, Ketu or Surya) ensures boils, piles, injuries to head and pimples. A watery sign (Karka, Vrischika, Meena) in lagna along with a watery planet (Chandra) could ensure cough, cold and breathing problems of epic. proportions. Same way earth signs (Vrishabha, Kanya and Makara) and earthy planets (Budh) could ensure indigestion and dehydration.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For incurable, painful and mysterious diseases planets like Shani, Surya, Rahu and Ketu in 6th or 8th house are responsible. Any sort of association of 6th and 8th house or their lords signals a lengthy time span of a disease. Different planets, bhavas and rashi''s control different parts of body. Careful consideration needs to be given to every aspect before judging health and vitality of a native. Cause of death is most likely deciphered through 8th house and 2nd house respectively. 6th house can be used to decipher addictions which are likely cause of future diseases. Shukra in 6th house gives addiction to drugs, excessive sweets, alcohol and sex. Guru in 6th house causes gluttony and obese body. Generally Shukra and Rahu are associated with addictions and their placements are to be observed to know the kind of addiction that a native may suffer from.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Health is very important aspect of life which cannot be ignored. While only the sick (especially those who can''t find cures) seek astrology for guidance it is not a bad idea to look into a horoscope and find the most likely disease a body can be affected with. This can ascertain preventive measures to be taken before there is sickness. As someone rightly said Prevention Is Better Than Cure.</p>', '', 0, 17, '2014-02-02 02:49:05', 899, '', '2014-04-08 06:26:25', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-02 02:49:05', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 1, '', '', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

Money can definitely buy pleasures but only sharing with family and friends can give real happiness. There maybe countless obstacles in life but when you have family, friends and well wishers all the difficulties in life seem trivial. A flower left alone would wither in no time and same way a person who is alone and lonely starts to feel sad and lonely after a while. The greatest assets in life are Friends and Family members and the greatest wealth in life is Health.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Importance of family is evident even in astrology where the 1st house&nbsp;in horoscope represents the native while the following house represents family of the native. 2nd House is also the karaka for life savings and assets. It wouldn''t be wrong to say that family is the greatest assets a person can have. If 2nd house has Guru or Shukra, the native is not only wealthy but also has a large family and loving members. The 3rd house is karaka for brothers and sisters. If it is in bad condition you can have quarrels, fights and irrepairable relationship with siblings. If it is in a good condition then native may derive benefits from brothers and sister. The 4th house is most important as it represents the mother. It is also a karaka for happiness. A good mother is the source of happines and unconditional love for the native. 5th house is the house of children while it is also a karaka for prestige. A child would give a good or bad name to their parents through their actions. 6th house shows Maternal Uncles and Aunts. 7th House is for life partner, 8th House represents the in-laws. 10th house is for father. It is also a house which represents your social standing in life. Father is a source of inspiration for most children and most children try to ape their father figure (sometimes mother or someone else becomes father figure). 12th house represent Paternal Uncles and Aunts.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A family is limited to house or social occassions. But through life''s roads be it schools, colleges or work is where you find the need for a friend. In astrology the 11th house governs friendship. It is worth mentioning that it also the House of Gains. A good 11th house would give benefits and a lot of friends. Friends can help through life''s roads and give appropriate guidance. The condition of 11th house and its lord decide whether you get friendship which help you achieve success or those that hinder your progress in life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To simplify things one person gets the family and friends not like he wants but like he is destined to have.

Depending on Shukra or Rahu''s transits proximity between the two concerned individuals increases and desire to live with them through thick and thin of life starts to arise. During those happy times an individual feels nothing wrong with his partner and overlooks all of his/her flaws. Love shows a world which is full of hope and optimism. The concerned lover starts to enjoy and appreciate the blue skies above him and the colorful flowers around him. When they finally arise from their imagination land thanks to the transits of Mr. Reality Check called Shani or Mr. Dissolution called Ketu they see The Ugly Truth Of Relationship.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While love is more of a privilege, relationship is more of a responsibility to stay together due to social norms. Everything is fine as long as you are in love but when that love disappears then you see the faults which you overlooked a long time ago. Suddenly the skies turn gray, sunshine is replaced by dark clouds and happiness is replaced by gloominess. All of a sudden lightning strikes his/her brain and he repents on how stupid he was to fall for the Relationship Trap. Bear in mind this is the critical point in life. Some individuals separate while other resourceful souls adapt and compromise while still staying together. The important thing to note is this is not due to any planetary yogas but through perseverance, satisfaction and compromise. This is the part where relationship changes from a duty to a privilege. Relationship is no longer a burden at this junction and becomes a relief to have been in a relation. Albeit this may take a lifetime to achieve and others quit and even try other alternatives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp;Whether you love a person, live in a relationship or have separated it is very important to understand that planetary combinations have a large say in it. While ultimately it is a choice of individuals the circumstances surrounding the choices are influenced by planets and past karma both good or bad.&nbsp;</p>', '', 0, 15, '2014-02-02 02:51:05', 899, '', '2014-04-08 06:25:31', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-02-02 02:51:05', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 3, 0, '', '', 1, 0, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', '');

(66, 236, 'Career', 'career', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The most asked questions in astrology are generally related to Marriage and Career. Quite an irony considering these two subjects are driven by <a title="prarabdha article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=87:prarabdha&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">Prarabdha</a>. It is human tendency to ask for happiness and satisfaction in life and that is not possible without a stable and successful career. The web based definition of Career is "An occupation for a significant period of person''s life with opportunities for progress". Focus is on Significant Period and Opportunities. Unless it is for a long duration there is no stability and without stability there is no happiness or peace. Without Opportunities there is no growth and without growth there are no profits or savings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;<a title="10th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19:karma-bhava&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">10th house</a> and <a title="6th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15:rog-sthana&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">6th house</a> are analyzed by astrologers for Career.

After all everyone is in the business of making money so why bother with 10th house and 6th house. Any connection of the 11th house with any other planetary lords of any house would ensure profits or income in the given field. In a way it is not a bad idea to ignore 6th house and 10th house. But life''s purpose is governed by the 10th house and life''s debt are measured by 6th house. Since income is governed by prarabdha it is imperative to check the 6th house for person''s debt or service he must undertake and 10th house to know the Karma which was planned for him. For example if you are meant to be a doctor and to serve poor and needy then Karma would drive you in a place where people are poor and needy. If you are meant to be surgeon and earn millions through operating then Karma would drive you in that direction. End of the day it all depends on life''s purpose. No point running away from it whatever income you get.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;If you are planning Career in Business or as Top Executive in an organization a strong 10th House is prerequisite.

(67, 241, 'Shani and Superstition', 'shani-and-superstition', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As explained in the article <a title="shani article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Shani</a> it is unncessarily feared and usually his effects are blown out of proportions. There are a couple of odd superstitions related with Shani. It is a human tendency to feel anger, anguish and fear of things which we do not comprehend. But it is necessary to understand the cause of fear and worries to get a solution in life. Here are a couple of superstitions commonly associated with Shani which are dispelled through adequate reasoning. Furthermore the activities done or suggested to pacify Shani are also properly analyzed.</p>\r\n<p><strong style="font-size: 1em;">Superstition 1: Shani Saade Saati is always bad</strong></p>\r\n<p>This is the most unwarranted fear I''ve come across. As soon as a Saade-Saati starts people start to think that the next seven and half years of life would be hell. Some smart ones refer to an astrologer and decipher the effects of all 3 phases of two and half period to know which is the worst and which is favorable for them. Even the Jyotish instills unnecessary fear in the native and gives them wrong message.</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani Saade Saati is an excellent time to burn past life karma be it good or bad. It only gives back what you''ve given in the past life and this life before the Saade Saati began. Depending on your karma all 3 subperiods could be good like heaven or bad like hell. So just think of doing good karma and eventually nothing bad would happen. Ofcourse progress is stalled but that doesn''t mean you don''t get the fruits of your hard work ever.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 2: Harsh Times go away by offering Oil to Shani and Lord Hanuman Idols</strong></h4>\r\n<p>This is another crazy theory propogated by astrologers and priest alike. Obviously they would make a fortune out of it so they would love to see more and more people coming to offer oil. Imagine a temple where everyone offers 100 ml of oil to the idols. Say 300 people come to the temple out of which 200 pour oil on the idol. That equates to 20 litre of oil being wasted on a Saturday alone. That are rough statistics for one temple. Say in India and abroad there are atleast 1000 temples of Lord Hanuman &amp; Shani. So Saturday amounts for 20,000 litres of oil wastage due to a stupid superstition. That oil could have been used to feed the poor, export to other countries or even cook for oneself (after all God resides in each and every soul)</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani is the karaka for Scarcity, Famine and Drought. Imagine you go to Sahara Desert and waste water in front of the native who resides there. You can imagine how angry he would be cause he has to struggle to get drinking water. Same way I can only imagine how mad Mr. Grandpa Shani would be by wastage of oil on idols. It is better to donate oil to a poor cause Shani is also a karaka for Poverty.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><strong>Superstition 3: Shani Chalisa and Shani Prayers are needed to calm the effects of furious Shani</strong></h4>\r\n<p>I''ve seen people do religious mantra, superstitious activities and speak prayers of God and Gramps Shani all day long. While I am not against prayers of God, prayers to planet are not right in my opinion. They are just planets who follow a fix trajectory. They won''t change their trajectory for anyone. So why bother appeasing them?</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani couldn''t care less about appeasement cause he is a judge of people''s karma and he has to stay impartial and deliver due justice to the native. It doesn''t matter to him if you are a King or Servant, Rich or Poor, Religious or Non-Believer. I would suggest prayers to your favorite Gods once and to keep calm and continue to do your duties. That would be like a mercy plea in front of Judge Shani and he would oblidge and give mercy for sure.</p>\r\n<h4>&nbsp;<strong>Superstition 4: Shani drishti is always bad</strong></h4>\r\n<p>These might not be totally false cause even the literatures on Shani propogate this theory. But what they also describe is Shani is the judge of one''s karma.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Reality: Shani gives results of past lives karma and that maybe an accumulation of many lives. Unless a native has done horrendous acts in his/her past lives it is not possible that horoscope houses which are aspected by Shani at birthtime keep on giving continuous bad results. What is necessary to know is Shani gives good or bad results to each house its transits or aspects when it moves in a Gochara Transit.</p>\r\n<p>In the end all I want to say is don''t fret about Shani like he is some relentless stalker or merciless killer. Just keep calm through periods of Shani and try to do your karma as effectively as you can. Understand that failures and disappointments are part and parcel of life and they help us stay grounded.</p>\r\n<p>Feel free to drop in a comment if you have any questions on the concerned article.</p>', '', 1, 20, '2014-02-04 08:12:14', 899, '', '2014-04-16 11:42:30', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 06:33:01', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 8, 3, '', '', 1, 69, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),

Materialistic Pleasures in life have taken precedence over the basic necessities of life like health.

Some astrologers count both Chandra and Lagna house as ascendent. Chances that you have a Mangal Dosha shoot up from 50% to about 75% if both <a title="chandra article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Chandra</a> and Lagna are counted as ascendent.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal Dosha is nothing to worry about. It is likely to be present in 50% of the population atleast. What is necessary to understand is the nature of Mangal. Mangal is fiery and strong, quick and trustworthy, harsh in speech but honest. Natives with a strong Mangal get angry quickly, are harsh in speech and fast excited and bored in relationship but it can also be said they are strong in calamities, trustworthy in relationship and honest with partners. So why the fear?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Marriage is a contract which cannot be declared void as it has clauses. It is an agreement which cannot be broken without consequences. So it is only natural for astrologers and believers to fear Mangal Dosha. After all you couldn''t live with a person who is angered, craves excessive sexual pleasures and is harsh in speech for your whole life. Slowly but surely the detachment (<a title="ketu article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=9:ketu&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Ketu</a>) and despair (<a title="shani article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Shani</a>) start to cloud a partner''s mind and partner eventually opts for divorce. Is it worth the risk going into marriage if such a scenario occurs? While these are far fetched theories and assumptions it is also necessary to accept that a human mind is prone to think positive or negative thoughts based on character and situations. Lets look at the most likely relationships which are likely to suffer adverse effects due to Mangal Dosha.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal in a horoscope (counted from lagna) casts a drishti on 4th, 7th and 8th house from its placement. In a marriage the native (suggested through 1st house), partner (suggested through 7th house), the immediate family of native (suggested through 2nd house) and immediate family of partner (suggested through 8th house), physical relationship (suggested through 12th house), vitality and life of native (suggested through 8th house) and life &amp; vitality of partner (suggested through 2nd house) play a very important role in long time survial of the marriage and Mangal in any of these locations is enough to bring Mangal Dosha into equation for astrologers. Mangal placement or drishti on the following houses causes problems according to astrologers. But it isn''t so wrong to say in today''s world as long as two people get along and have good physical relationship everything else is trivial. In the long term even the physical relationship is redundant and only the repo between two individuals is primary. But since humans like to socialize every equation for relationship is taken into consideration by astrologers.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are various remedies on Mangal Dosha provided as mentioned below:</p>\r\n<p>1. Marrying another person with Mangal Dosha which may not always be useful</p>\r\n<p>2. Doing a Kumbh Vivah ceremony which requires native to marry a tree or idol of Vishnu before actual marriage. This practise may or may not give desired results. It is advised to only proceed if you have faith in this ceremony otherwise not to do if you feel it is superstitious and waste of time.</p>\r\n<p>3. Fasting from first tuesday of a month based on lunar calendar. This helps greatly especially if no salt is consumed on tuesday and less salt is consumed on other days. Reduction in sodium and potassium level not only reduces blood pressure but it also reduces excessive energy and fiery emotions in natives with a Mangal Dosha</p>\r\n<p>4. Donating blood once every three month. While this solution has no scientific or religious validity associated it is not a bad idea just for the sake of blood donation drive to prosper. It doesn''t harm an individual if blood is donated and it also helps the society.</p>\r\n<p>5. Worship Hanuman, reciting Sunder Kand and visiting Hanuman temples. This helps greatly cause Lord Hanuman is lord of wisdom. He has strength and courage but is humble and submissive at the same time. This trait is subconsiously cultiaved in native by prayers to Lord Hanuman.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mangal Dosha is not as troublesome issue for marriage as it is made out to be. All it requires is to be aware of it if indeed present in horoscope and if this dosha is not cancelled by other factors.

(74, 247, 'Visha Yoga', 'visha-yoga', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Visha Yoga is the combination of <a title="shani article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Shani</a>+<a title="chandra article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Chandra</a> in a horoscope. Visha means Poison and this yoga can act as poison in life of individual. This yoga generally occurs every 27 days as it takes 27 days for moon to complete its rotation of earth and navigate via the <a title="12 rashi article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=category&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=148">12 Rashis</a> in a horoscope. While this yoga is catastrophic for most, it has been shown that a few natives do rise above this bad placement and do wonders in their respective fields. Visha Yoga is also called as Nitrubhasha Yoga or Shani-Chandra yoga.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The very name Visha Yoga is enough to send jitters down the spine of many. If the angle between Shani and Chandra is less then 12 degrees than it is rest assured that these yoga would show you hell on earth. Imagine yourself being assigned to a prison where you are bound by chains and there is is a stern and relentless warden who beats with a whip at the slightest mistake. If you imagine the pain, fear and trauma you are close to understanding what Vish Yoga natives feel inside their head. Abeit it is the mind of the natives which makes a mountain out of mole hill but the trauma experienced is similar to lifetime sentence in a dark, lonely prison. &nbsp;However <a title="vedic astrology link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=61:vedic-astrology&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">Vedic Astrology</a> is a classic case of paradox. What is written is quite opposite of what is observed. Many Vish Yoga natives are quite successful in life and can even be great contributors to the society. However what is largely observed is these natives get very low returns for the substantial amount of efforts put in. Unless they work very hard it is difficult for them to achieve anything in life.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To understand Vish Yoga well we need to understand the characteristics of the two planets which form the Vish Yoga. Shani known as Saturn is made up of poisonous gases among other substances. Chandra known as Moon is responsible for causing tides and ebbs in the ocean as well as liquid substance in body. In astrology Chandra is the karaka for mind. Shani poisons the mind of a native so the term <strong><span style="color: #000000;">Vish Yoga</span>&nbsp;</strong>is used. Digging deeper into the subject. Shani is the karaka for fear, oppression, scarcity, povery and hard work while Chandra is the karaka for emotions, unrequited love, affection and mother. Both of the planets are polar opposites in terms of personality and characteristics. When these two opposing planets combine in a horoscope they tend to constantly collide with each other on matters of ideologies. The mind of the native cannot make up whether he should guide his emotions or let emotions guide him. Naturally what follows is depression and despair- a typical trait of Vish Yoga natives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The picture is far more gloomy cause they may even become paranoid incapable of trusting others or believing in power of love. They are always physically tired and mentally exhausted. Often they attempt suicide but Shani would not let them take an escape route. Ofcourse some poor souls do use that option but that road is ill-advised for Vish Yoga natives.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shani is a cruel planet and association with karaka of mind makes the mind become cruel as well. Many dicatator and oppressors have Vish Yoga in their horoscope. These yoga also creates an emotional oppressor and such natives have often been observed to oppress others or give pain and despair to others. If <a title="mangal article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Mangal</a> is associated they may actually derive happiness from torturing and harassing others. If <a title="guru article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Guru</a> is involved they could actually help others instead of harming and practise empathy.&nbsp;Vish Yoga natives are quite harsh in speech. If Mangal is associated with Shani-Chandra placement then natives are observed to be sarcastic also. However if a benefic Guru is aspecting the house where Shani-Chandra placement occurs then effects are neutralized. If Rahu is present with Shani+Chandra then the effects are greatly increased and there is no way for native to recover. Generally any sort of association of Chandra, Shani and <a title="rahu article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Rahu</a> via aspect or placement suggests a life which is result of very bad karmas in past lives. &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So how to tackle this difficult placement? It is not at all easy. Whether to choose mandate of duties and responsibilties given by Shani or whether to go with emotions, love and care bestowed by Chandra.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Solution: Get your horoscope analyzed by an astrologer. If Vish Yoga is in a friendly rashi or exaltion rashi of Chandra then go with emotions otherwise all other scenarios go for duties and responsibilities of Shani. As long as you take one of the path rest all should work out fine. No matter which path you take you would require concrete efforts (Shani) to get your objective. So whether you are looking to help the world (Chandra) or bend the world (Shani) you need to focus on that objective. Do not dwell too much on other things and you are bound to end up as success in life.</p>\r\n<p>Remedies: All solutions for Vish Yoga are useless without prayers to Lord Shiva. Lord Shiva is the remover of darkness and negativity, the drinker of poison and God of Knowledge. Recitation of ''Om Namah Shivay'' specifically in evening and night is advised when moon is present. Also prayers to Lord Jesus or Lord Vishnu or any of his avatar are advised. They are gods of compassion and love. They teach to love and help mankind.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 14, '2014-03-24 11:10:58', 899, '', '2014-04-21 10:22:15', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 10:14:40', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 11, 0, 'shani chandra yoga, nitrubhasha yoga, yogas by shani, yogas by chandra', 'vish yoga description', 1, 149, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(75, 249, 'Neech Bhanga Raja Yoga', 'nbry', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not much is said about Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga (NBRY) in traditional Vedic Astrology. It was later propogated by new age astrologers through case studies and experience. However what has largely been observed is there are valid reasons to believe that such yoga occurs in a horoscope. Neecha Bhanga Raja Yoga is best explained by the story <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Frog_Prince_(story)" target="_blank">Frog Prince</a> written by Grimm Brothers. Nothing in this world inspires people more then the underdog who fights all odds and wins. Rags to Riches story is an inspiration for all people who dream of similar fate.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; NBRY in simple terms is a yoga which leads an underdog to perform above average deeds and acts. But for NBRY to occur a fundamental law is that the concerned person has to see humiliation and defeat in early part of life so much so that most of those around him start to question the native''s credentials. But these same humiliations and defeats are slowly but surely building the character of native. He starts to see things differently and sooner or later starts to find the ingredients which make him successful and renowned. Ofcourse to the outsiders who questioned him can never imagine that such a worthless scum could achieve unparalleled success so they merely pass it off as Got Lucky but for the native the story is different. He knows the hard work, sweat, patience and noble intentions he had to cultivate to reach that place among elites. In a way it can be said that the Neecha characteristics of the planet never goes away and such natives inspite of their position in life are always questioned by those around.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Neecha Bhanga has some rules which are needed for its cancellation of neecha chracteristics. Some primary factors are mentioned below:</p>\r\n<ol>\r\n<li>Neecha planet occupies the <a title="vishnu sthana article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=86:vishnu&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">Vishnu Sthana</a> or <a title="laxmi sthana article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85:laxmi&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">Laxmi Sthana</a> from the <a title="lagna article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=10:tanu-bhava&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">Lagna</a> or <a title="chandra article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Chandra</a> counted as Lagna.</li>\r\n<li>One of the co-tenants along with the neecha planet is an uccha planet or lord of the rashi (for eg. <a title="guru article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Guru</a> in Makara Lagna along with <a title="shani article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=7:shani&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Shani</a> or <a title="mangal article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Mangal</a> as co-tenant)&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>Neecha planet is retrograde (for eg. Retrograde <a title="budh article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:budh&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Budh</a> in <a title="meena rashi article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33:pisces&amp;catid=12:12-rashis&amp;Itemid=148">Meena Rashi</a> produces NBRY if Guru is located in <a title="karka rashi article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=25:cancer&amp;catid=12:12-rashis&amp;Itemid=148">Karka Rashi</a> and native has Meena Lagna).&nbsp;</li>\r\n<li>If the ruler of rashi of neecha planet is in kendra and in an uccha sthana or own rashi &nbsp;(for eg. Shani in <a title="mesha rashi article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=22:aries&amp;catid=12:12-rashis&amp;Itemid=148">Mesha Rashi</a> would cause neecha bhanga if Mangal is in <a title="makara rashi article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=31:capricorn&amp;catid=12:12-rashis&amp;Itemid=148">Makara Rashi</a>)</li>\r\n<li>If the neecha planet is located in an uccha navamsha in Vishnu or Laxmi Sthana</li>\r\n<li>If the neecha planet has good Ashtvarga strength.</li>\r\n</ol>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These are rough points and really there is actually a lot more to the equation. The term ''Neecha Bhanga'' actually differs from the term ''NBRY''. Neecha Bhanga is just the cancellation of neecha characteristics. In other words Neecha Bhanga leads person to lead a normal or above normal existence but does not have the capacity to turn a beggar into a king. Many people see Neecha Bhanga in their life cause one of the above equations is possible to be present in the horoscope. But NBRY has that capacity to turn dirt into gold. That rarely happens in my humble opinion.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One way to know about NBRY is to check the above mentioned points for NBRY particularly the first four points, Afterwards try to honestly answer if you have found your higher purpose in life. As crazy as it sounds people with NBRY tend to live a life devoted to a fixed purpose and that purpose generally involves well-being of others. So if you are still restricted to personal well-being you are not ready to get the NBRY in your horoscope even if present. After all it is not easy to care for others who hurt you and make fun of you. When you learn to accept criticism with dignity and achieve patience, hope, faith and humility is the time when NBRY gives full fruit. More important then that is your purpose to do something in life which would benefit others. At that time even the Gods would bend down and give respect so how can planets be an exception.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 14, '2014-03-24 11:16:05', 899, '', '2014-04-16 07:06:56', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 10:16:35', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 8, 0, 'neecha bhanga, neech bhang, neech bhanga, yogas for elevation', 'neech bhanga raja yoga description', 1, 112, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(76, 251, 'Vipreeta Raja Yoga', 'vry', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipreeta Raja Yoga like <a title="neecha bhanga raja yoga link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=75:nbry&amp;catid=14:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=165">NBRY</a>&nbsp;didn''t have much prominence in the early Vedic Astrology. But later in modern astrology these yogas have gained prominence. Vipreeta Raja Yoga (VRY) is a yoga formed when the lord of dushamsthanas are located in dushamsthanas. There are a host of rules for occurence or cancellation of these yoga which are discussed in details in this article.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first and foremost thing to understand is Vipreeta Raja Yoga is essentially a dushamsthana planet in a <a title="dushamsthana article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89:dushamsthanas&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">dushamsthana</a> placement. In mathamatics two negatives always result in positive but in astrology it is not always the case though astrology is highly influenced by mathematics. Even if VRY occurs in life it actually take time before it gives fruition just like NBRY. Normally period of 36-42 years may already have passed before the circumstances turn Vipreeta or opposite to past and current bad scenario. Life is always ready to provide opportunities to individuals but the Prarabdha determines whether the concerned native would make the most of ray of hope provided or let it pass.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>First we would look at the various types of Vipreeta Raja Yoga</p>\r\n<p>1. Harsh Yoga: When lord of <a title="12th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=21:vyaya-bhava&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">12th house</a> is in 6th house then Harsha Yoga is said to be formed. Some text mention lord of any dushamsthana house in 6th house gives rise to Harsh Yoga. This yoga makes a person fortunate, happy, invincible, strong, sturdy, wealthy and famous.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>2. Sarala Yoga: When lord of <a title="8th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=17:mrityu-sthana&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">8th house</a> is located in 8th house then Sarala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamsthana houses in 8th house causes Sarala Yoga. This yoga makes a person long-lived, fearless, happy, invincible, learned, a terror to his enemies, wealthy, famous, celebrated and prosperous.</p>\r\n<p>3. Vimala Yoga: When lord of the <a title="6th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=15:rog-sthana&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">6th house</a> occupies the 12th house, Vimala Yoga is formed. Some text say lord of any dushamstahana in 12th house causes Vimala Yoga. This yoga makes a person independent, endowed with noble qualities, wealthy, happy and economical in spending.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>There are rules of cancellation of VRY which are mentioned below.</p>\r\n<p>1. The lord of Dushamsthana Houses is also a lord of Laxmi Sthanas</p>\r\n<p>2. When there is <a title="parivartana yoga link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=83:payo&amp;catid=14:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=165">Parivartana Yoga</a> between any of the Dushamsthana House Lords.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>3. Lords of <a title="10th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=19:karma-bhava&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">10th house</a> or <a title="laxmi sthana article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=85:laxmi&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">Laxmi Sthanas</a> should not be present in the dushamsthana house where VRY occurs. For example: For Mithuna Lagna lord of house 6 is <a title="mangal article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3:mangal&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Mangal</a>. If Mangal is located in 12th house then Vimala Yoga is formed. But if <a title="guru article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Guru</a> or <a title="budh article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=4:budh&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Budh</a> is also present with Mangal in 12th house then the result of VRY won''t be obtained.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipreeta Raja Yogas are too difficult to judge just like NBRY. Countless permutations and combinations have to be deciphered before coming to the right conclusion. What is generally observed is most of natives with a dushamsthana lord in dushamstha house are presented with some sort of help against the flow of circumstances. Some take that helping hand and do wonders in their life while others keep on looking for all the lights to turn green and they never do turn green. If you have a dushamsthana planet in a dushamsthana location the best thing to do is keep calm and work towards a fixed goal. When there is an opportunity presented that same calmness and previous efforts would give fruitful results.&nbsp;</p>', '', 1, 14, '2014-03-24 11:19:43', 899, '', '2014-04-21 14:31:18', 899, 0, '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '2014-03-24 10:21:21', '0000-00-00 00:00:00', '{"image_intro":"","float_intro":"","image_intro_alt":"","image_intro_caption":"","image_fulltext":"","float_fulltext":"","image_fulltext_alt":"","image_fulltext_caption":""}', '{"urla":false,"urlatext":"","targeta":"","urlb":false,"urlbtext":"","targetb":"","urlc":false,"urlctext":"","targetc":""}', '{"show_title":"","link_titles":"","show_tags":"","show_intro":"","info_block_position":"","show_category":"","link_category":"","show_parent_category":"","link_parent_category":"","show_author":"","link_author":"","show_create_date":"","show_modify_date":"","show_publish_date":"","show_item_navigation":"","show_icons":"","show_print_icon":"","show_email_icon":"","show_vote":"","show_hits":"","show_noauth":"","urls_position":"","alternative_readmore":"","article_layout":"","show_publishing_options":"","show_article_options":"","show_urls_images_backend":"","show_urls_images_frontend":""}', 8, 0, 'virpreeta raja yoga, viprit raj yoga, yogas for exaltion', 'vipreeta raja yoga in horoscope', 1, 116, '{"robots":"","author":"","rights":"","xreference":""}', 0, '*', ''),
(77, 253, 'Vipra Chandal Yoga', 'vcy', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vipra Chandal Yoga (VCY) is the yoga formed when <a title="guru article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Guru</a> and <a title="rahu article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=8:rahu&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=118">Rahu</a> combine together in the same house in a horoscope. It is also called Guru Chandal Yoga. This yoga generally arises when a native has insulted or wronged a honest, pious and spiritual soul in the past livesl.&nbsp;Vipra in Sanskrit means a brahmin or pious soul while Chandal means a ghastly, roaming and uncultured person. Guru is considered Vipra while Rahu is considered Chandal so the name Vipra Chandal Yoga. Ofcourse modern day interpretation of Rahu is quite different. Today Rahu represents the PR (Public Relations) Machine who can sell anything whether the product or person is worth the money or not. Alas! No matter how good the packaging is if the product isn''t nice then there are bound to be unhappy customers. Similar is the fate of modern day PR Machine called Rahu, Eventually people see through the deceit and cunningness and you can expect tomatoes, shoes and eggs being hurled at you if you go by Rahu''s fake PR.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every 7-8 years the smart, quiet, sensible, pious and religious Guru combines with the faker, poser, liar in Rahu and the problematic VCY is formed. When two opposing grahas combine in a horoscope house there are bound to be fights and struggles. In normal scenario two grahas located in one horoscope house start to get along after sometime and learn to adjust and accommodate each other. Sometimes they even compliment each other but when Rahu combines with any graha the opposite is true. Rahu is desire, lust and greed personified. Rahu may turn good and humble for few days but inner cravings and desire don''t go away. Sooner or later he resorts to illegal, unreligious and unethical activities to get the things he desires. The problem here is Guru is so religious and righteous that he cannot fathom illegal activities. So the cursed yoga called VCY or Guru Chandal Yoga is formed.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When two or more grahas are in the same horoscope the strongest placement always wins and dictates terms for other grahas. So if Guru is strong in a &nbsp;horoscope then he would dictate terms and generally a good character, religious nature and honest individual is observed. But if Rahu is strong then person is drawn by immoral activities, is an athiest or fakes religion for personal gains and even resorts to illegal activities. Before judging the effects of Guru Chandal Yoga it is necessary to get your horoscope analysed and know the strength of Guru.

This yoga occurs when a righteous person is insulted or wronged so it is only natural to correct that wrong by giving the right respect back to a righteous person. Prayers to Lord Dattatreya or chanting of Vishnu Sahasaranama are also advised. Try not to do any special poojas unless it is absolutely necessary.

Prarabdha in English means Fate.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Prarabdha of an individual plays a big part in shaping his life. If an individual is meant to rise from Rags to Riches then Prarabdha pushes him in that direction. If he is meant to fall down from a top position in life then Prarabdha pushes him in that direction. It all depends on karma of an individual or in other words Purushartha. To a believer of Prarabdha, fate controls the destiny while for a believer of Purushartha, hard work controls the destiny. Actually the reality is somewhere in the middle.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prarabdha and Purushartha are not on collision course but rather run parallel and meet at some point of the road. The Purushartha of today becomes the Prarabdha of tomorrow. The Prarabdha faced today maybe a result of Purshartha of yesterday. Similarly today''s Prarabdha may decide the Purushartha for tomorrow.

It is the driving force and the foremost reason why astrology gets it wrong in terms of forecasting future of the native. Just like there are Variants, Pie Values, Friction and Worst Case Scenarios in Mathematics, Science and Programming which cause calculations to go awry there is Purushartha in astrology which puts all the calculations as meaningless and native achieves things which cannot be calculated at birth. This single word maligns astrology like no other one does yet this article is only meant to praise this nemesis called Purushartha cause it is truly a great nemesis.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Purushartha is nothing but hard work without any sort of expectations in return. The very essence of Bhagvad Gita can summarize Purushartha like no one else can:</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;"One cannot achieve anything without doing Karma (Purushartha). Don''t try to get anything for free. No work is bereft of gains. One should not ever get depressed in life.

So people who loathe fate and luck should not get agitated at those who believe in it and those who believe in fate and luck should understand that today''s hard work is tomorrow''s good luck. Some people are born with the knowledge of what Purushartha he needs to pursue to be successful in life. Generally they are the people who taunt everyone else with early success. What they fail to realize is that Prarabdha was responsible for making them pursue the respected field and gain success. By taunting others today''s bad karma would become bad Prarabdha for tomorrow and hit them hard on the face.&nbsp;In similar manner people who believe too much in luck and fate refuse to get out of their cocoon and work hard towards a fixed objective. What they fail to realize is today''s Purushartha would result in good karma and ultimately good Prarabdha in the future.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There is a dilemma in people when it comes to using Purushartha or &nbsp;applying Prarabdha.

To be more precise one should try hard for a good character, good health, good education, being religious as well try hard to get peace and happiness, think of death and rebirths and also work towards minimizing losses as well as gaining liberation from cycle of life and death by attaining Moksha.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Astrologers are generally not sought until situation is worse and all hope is lost. Some people are highly negative and consult astrologers to find out the right time to eat and sleep. What I personally advise is to learn about your Purushartha or goal of your life from astrologers as nothing is wrong in that. After that only visit him in times of calamity for solutions if possible through astrology. An honest astrologer is sure to give you right advise about the right course of action to take.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally don''t lose hope when all is lost and don''t get over the moon when you gain everything you''ve set out to do.

But knowing is believing and believing leads to change. Till there is sickness there is no value for health, till there is death there is no value for life and till there is loss there is no value of careful spending. It is an irony in itself that Dushamsthanas are not studied or asked about until there is death, disease, sickness and monetary losses.

These things are in the hands of Prarabdha. But the matters of dushamsthans specifically addiction, debt, sickness and loss as well as suffering are in our hands. We may not be able to prevent sickness but we can definitely work towards cure. We cannot prevent monetary losses but we can very well plan to cut short these losses. We cannot plan for suffering we are receiving but we can very well plan to ease those suffering.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is quite amusing to know no one gives a damn about Dushamsthans until tragedy strikes.

If these three points indicate a positive outlook then nothing bad can fall on native with matters of the dushamsthana house. It is rarely possible that whole of native remains good or bad but if dushamsthana houses are having negative placements then rest assured whole life would have difficulties, diseases, debt and despair.

But since ancient texts do point to a demon called Rahu whose head got severed by Lord Vishnu we would do injustice to Rahu and Ketu if we do not consider&nbsp;them in Vedic Astrology. But an important question is can these two shadow planets really block out the effects of seven powerful grahas. In Vedic Astrology it is definitely true that Rahu and Ketu both affect the house where they reside and Rahu in addition also affects the houses it cast drishti/aspect on namely <a title="5th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=14:putra-bhava&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">5th house</a>, <a title="7th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=16:kalatra-bhava&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">7th house</a> and <a title="9th house article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=18:dharma-bhava&amp;catid=11:12-bhavas&amp;Itemid=119">9th house</a>. But it would be foolhardy to say Rahu and Ketu can control whole life of an individual just by having seven planets in between the rashi''s where they reside. I''ve come across various horoscopes with the supposed Kaal Sarpa Dosham but I''ve yet to come across any horoscope whose life is a miserable hell due to Kaal Sarpa Dosha compared to other hell yogas like <a title="Visha Yoga" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=74:visha-yoga&amp;catid=14:imp-yogas&amp;Itemid=165">Vish Yoga</a>, Kemdruma Yoga, Planets in <a title="Dushamsthanas article link" href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=89:dushamsthanas&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117">Dushamsthanas</a> &nbsp;or Shraapit Yoga. I admit progress of natives is stalled due to the supposed Kaal Sarpa Dosham but natives have risen to good positions with time. &nbsp;Lets bifuricate Kaal Sarpa Dosha further.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the most important thing to note is Kaal Sarpa Yoga has all planets on one side of horoscope if Rahu is counted as lagna and Ketu as 7th house. What that means is there are less chances of aspects as most grahas cast a drishti on 7th house from themselves. There is a far greater chance of planets improving with time as long as there is no aspect involved. Long story short the supposed Kaal Sarp Dosha gives the best chance to improving a grahas/planets condition in rashi as long as Rahu is not a co-tenant. If you look at the other articles on Kaal Sarpa Yoga they are sure to give you indications that conditions improve after certain time for Kaal Sarp Yoga natives. What they don''t tell you is conditions improve not due to Kaal Sarp Yoga but cause grahas mature and learn the art of co-existence if placed in same rashi, that grahas learn to turn adversity into opportunity and weakness into strengths with time. But the essential part is it takes time and by time I mean mid-life for grahas to learn art of co-existence. Whether you now believe in Kaal Sarpa Dosha is upto you. But do remember the important part that individuals with supposed Kaal Sarpa Dosha do get improvement in life with a period of time. So there is no need for the fake poojas to negate the effect of Kaal Sarpa Dosha as it won''t really do you any good. No need to pour milk on Vasuki or Shiva Lingam. I am not against poojas but I believe that Lord Shiva would be more happy to see milk being given to a poor/hungry soul be it human who cannot afford it or an animal who is hungry. After all Shiva and Jeeva (Living Being) are one and the same and Shiva resides in all Jeevas (Living Beings). So please the Jeevas and you automatically please the Shiva aka God. No planet in this solar system or all the various universes is more powerful then Shiva (Almighty God).&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Those who are student of astrology should try looking at various horoscopes with or without Kaal Sarpa Yoga. If there is Rahu in co-existence with a particular graha or many grahas then none of them improve with time. In similar manner those with aspects by Shani and Rahu also don''t improve much with time. But those planets without aspect of Shani/Rahu and Rahu as co-tenant are sure to improve over time irrelevant of Kaap Sarp Yoga or any other yoga present in horoscope.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This article was not meant to offend anyone.

(92, 76, 'Power Of Mantras', 'mantra-power', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Most Hindus speak some or other vedic mantras in the morning. People of other faiths often try some or other sort of prayers. &nbsp;But do we actually know what we are doing? Most would say it is to please God and ensure a fruitful day. Really!! If God was pleased by a prayer or mantra there would be no need for hard work, patience and conviction. Before anyone dishes me for negative views on prayers please understand I am not against prayers or mantras. As a matter of fact I am very much in favor of people doing prayers and reciting sacred mantras. But what I want is for people to know the reason for existence of such mantras and not just recite them mindlessly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;First and foremost there are different sort of mantras with some to invoke Gods and some others to bring inner peace and equilibrium. Other more powerful mantras for tantra and siddhis are not discussed as it is outside the scope of this article. The &nbsp;simpler ones like ''Om Namah Shivay'' or ''Gayatri Mantra'' are to bring peace and stability in inner-self. Sanskrit is a phonetic language (related to sounds). It deals with sound and amplification like a few other languages can possibly hope to do. So when you speak ''Om'' ॐ&nbsp;and when you speak ''Ommmmmmmmmmmm'' ओम&nbsp;there is a huge difference (try it to believe it). The vibrations caused by ''Ommmmmmmmmmmm'' ओओओओओओमममममम&nbsp;would relax your mind and body. The middle dot on&nbsp;''Om''&nbsp;ॐ which translates to&nbsp;''Ommmmmmmmmmmm''&nbsp;ओओओओओओमममममम is missing from our prayers and that is why they have no effect. So the next time you say ''Om Namah Shivay''&nbsp;ॐ नमः शिवाय be sure to speak it slowly and understand that quality and not quantity is important when speaking the sacred mantra. Just a Mala or 108 times of recitation of Om Namah Shivay is enough to relax your mind and body and also create positive and happy outlook.&nbsp;The word&nbsp;OM&nbsp;when recited slowly has the same frequency as earth which is 7.83 hz (hertz). It provides balance of body and mind and gives instant relaxation. Also it increases blood circulation and oxygen transfer to different organs. Hormonal Glands also function properly due to&nbsp;OM&nbsp;mantra. The magical word Shiva removes all negativity and anger from the body.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3 align="center">Proper Method of Saying Om &amp; The Gayatri Mantra</h3>\r\n<div style="float: left;"><iframe width="200" height="150" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/jMaAKkNyB4o?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<div style="float: right;"><iframe width="200" height="150" src="//www.youtube.com/embed/P26ZvKY--KY?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>\r\n<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The famous Gayatri Mantra is said to be the most powerful mantras of all. But when you speak this mantra know that it is to connect the inner-self with a higher conscious. In simpler terms it is achieving oneness with God. It is a Dhyan Mantra (concentration mantra) and works best when concentration for work is needed. Similarly simple mantras like ''Shree Ram Jai Ram, Jai Jai Ram'' are too simple but when spoken slowly and using related sound effect like (Shreeeeee Rammmmmmm Jaiiiiii Rammmmm Jaiiiii Jaiiii Rammmmm) you would understand the difference. When you speak a sanskrit sloka/mantra be sure to use hymnn or sound effect and it would do wonders. Prayers are best done in the morning prior to sunrise but even if it is not possible in morning try and recite prayers on an empty stomach after bathing. The reason: The mind is fresh in the morning, an empty stomach improves concentration and bathing provides freshness to the body. Simple isn''t it. But Alas!! Few people do it accordingly.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Prayers and Mantras are important for a healthy mind just as much as Yoga and Exercise are important for a healthy body. 15-30 minutes of prayers won''t kill anyone. But be sure to do it slowly and practise use of phonetics (sound) associated with the concerned mantras. It would yield far better results.

(93, 90, 'Numerology: Facts vs Fictions', 'numerology-myth', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A lot of people in Hinduism have started looking at numerology in high esteem. What''s more problematic is even astrologers born in India who should follow Vedic Astrology have started promoting this number crunching farce. I generally agree with globalism but not with stupidism. Remember Vedic Astrology was a well researched subject way before Christianity or the Christian Calendar were even born. Western Astrology has its good points but numerology is just a waste of time. To do astrology based on numbers especially those related to Gregorian Calendar is bit silly for Vedic Astrologers. Astrology is all maths and numbers but those equations, permutations and combinations are not really related to the Christian Calendar we follow today. Keep in mind this is by no means to show Christianity or Jesus in poor light. Jesus Christ was a great soul and his original teachings are worth following by everyone.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; What Vedic Astrologers have done is adapt the Vedic System of casting horoscopes and giving predictions to the Gregorian Calendar- A big flaw in my opinion. Unfortunately not much is known how astrologers during the Vedic Period (before 2500 BC) used to derive results on astrology. So we have to take the Gregorian Calendar as reference point since there is little or no choice. While that would suffice for horoscope predictions as they''ve been adapted (with flaws ofcourse) one should definitely look out for number theories as lot of dates in Gregorian Calendar are subject to scrutiny. Say most numerologist believe number &nbsp;''8'' as an unlucky number. Any date of birth or residential house number with number which adds upto 8 is considered unlucky. But the fun part is Chinese hosted the Olympics on 8/8/2008 at exactly 8:08 AM. And they got the highest gold medal tally for Olympics 2008. M. K. Gandhi''s date of birth adds upto 8. So does Nelson Mandela''s birth date add upto 8. You could argue they struggled a lot but the famous stars and musicians like Penelope Cruz, Jason Statham and Enrique Iglesias also have the total of their birth date as 8. Well I don''t see how their Page 3 lifestyle are so unlucky. Similarly number 6 is considered a bit problematic but anyone would love to live life of Hugh Hefner wouldn''t he? His birth total comes to number 6. Similary number 9 is considered very lucky yet there are countless people with a miserable life inspite of having that lucky number.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Western astrology deals with very generalised predictions. Even Vedic Astrology used for daily prediction is a waste of time. Still if people ask for it astrologers are obliged to prepare a prediction no matter how generalized it might seem. Instead I fully endorse the moon''s tithi/date even though sometimes it maybe wrong. Most people born near Full Moon have been observed to get less sleep, are quite impatient but generally good cultured and quite religious. People born near No Moon day enjoy quite a good sleep, are calm and collective but have little or no manners. They are not very religious either. Here also numbers are used as 15 for New Moon and 0 for No Moon. But proper research is required to further validate my theory. At present data is insufficient to present estimates. When you make use of Western Astrology be it Numerology or Sun Sign prediction be sure to understand it is a very generalized theory and only works a few time. Even Vedic Astrology based on Moon Sign is to a point generalized and ideal to disown it. Day to day activities are better left on <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88:purushartha&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117" title="purushartha article link">Purushartha</a>. Go to an astrologer to seek a new direction in life but never consult an astrologer to know your day to day fortunes.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even after this if you want to know if good luck would sign your way then there is a simple technique. Look at your Gochara Chart (available on various apps, websites and softwares). No need to know the details. Just count the position of <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=2:chandra&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=107" title="chandra article link">Chandra</a> from <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:guru&amp;catid=10:9-planets&amp;Itemid=107" title="guru article link">Guru</a>. Include the house of Guru in the count as well (it is 1st house in counting). If the count comes to 1, 5, 11 and 9 then chances are luck would shine your way. If the count comes to 6, 8 and 12 then it may mean you need to take care on those days for your health and finances. If there is an auspicious day (शुभ दिन) and your Chandra counted from Guru comes to 1, 5 or 9 then try taking major decisions (especially big financial transactions) in a good Muhurat. Chances of failure are very low if this is done.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A simple number cannot make or break a person. Neither can a date of birth or time of birth. The ancient sages and rishis devise the astrology based on planets and star transition, not on numbers and dates. Even after that if you want to know your day-to-day luck then it is best advised to follow the simple technique explained in the 3rd paragraph.

(94, 92, 'Good Luck Charms', 'lucky-charms', '<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Many people bring items like Laughing Buddha, Shree Yantra and Chinese Bamboo without knowing what they are and what is their purpose. Someone advised them it would bring good luck and that is enough for them to spend a fortune on it. Let me start by saying these remedies for good luck actually work but only when you know what they mean and what is their importance. If you just buy them and put it in your house there is absolutely no effect. So start by knowing what they are and you would actually start getting the luck you always wanted on your side.</p>\r\n<h1>Laughing Buddha:</h1>\r\n<p>&nbsp;<img style="float: left;" src="images/laughingbuddha.png" alt="" />&nbsp; His real name is Budai in Chinese and Japanese refer to him as Hotei. His name implies cloth sack because of the sack he always carried on his back which was made of old clothes. He was a poor man who carried a cloth sack, prayer beads (Mala) and a bowl for seeking alms or begging. So the question now on everyone''s mind would be how can a poor man who used to beg and worn torn clothes actually make you happy. It is not the Laughing Buddha Idol which makes you happy but the message he carries which would make you happy. Even though Budai (Laughing Buddha) was poor, wore old and torn clothes and used to beg he was always happy. He was content and peaceful with whatever the world had to offer him. He used to bring happiness to those around him and loved to entertain children. The message he puts across is very important and would bring you all the happiness you ever need. His message is simple and sweet: <strong>"Be content and satisfied in life no matter what it has to offer you. Always keep a happy and positive outlook in life no matter how difficult the circumstances. Give happiness to all those around you especially children and you would never be unhappy in life"</strong>. The Laughing Buddha Idol is to remind you of that precious message. Otherwise you could bring hundreds of his idol and you would still be unhappy in life. Make sure to understand his message and you wouldn''t ever be sad again in your life.</p>\r\n<h1><span style="text-align: justify;">Shree Yanra:&nbsp;</span></h1>\r\n<p style="text-align: justify;"><img style="float: left;" title="Shree Yantra" src="images/Shree_Yantra.png" alt="Shree Yantra" /><img style="float: right;" title="Shree Yantra Petals" src="images/Shree_Yantra2.png" alt="Shree Yantra With Petals" />Most people are aware of Shree Yantra and know that it brings wealth and prosperity in the house. But just by keeping in the house this powerful yantra does nothing. It is the geometry associated with the design and the effect it has on the subconscious which does the magic.&nbsp;Shree Yantra is a complex diagram based on geometry. It contains five triangles in downward position while four triangles are placed in upward position. The point in middle is called bindu. The center point called bindu when stared at for 5 minutes would balance the right and left brain lobes. All the triangles are isoscles. The four triangles facing upwards represent Shiva the male energy while the five triangles facing downwards represent Shakti the female energy. These nine triangles are surrounded by two circles made of petals with the inner which has eight petals while the outer which has sixteen petals. These two circle petals signify creation and reproductive vital force. The four corners represent the supposed four openings of the universe. The Shree Yantra diagram on the right side is the more accurate of the two while the left diagram of the Shree Yantra is more to show focus of middle point (bindu) which increases concentration.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Lets get back to astrological importance of Shree Yantra. Shree Yantra is a complex diagram which stimulates the brain. When certain mantras are spoken while looking at the Shree Yantra the effect on body and mind amplifies. Average human being only uses 1 or 2% of his total brain capacity. The more smarter ones at most use 10% of their brains capacity. The Shree Yantra when stared at has the power to awaken the dormant parts of the brain and awaken hidden thinking and analytical skills in a human. If spoken with sacred mantras like Gayatri Mantra or Maha Laxmi mantra it would open up host of creative ideas in your brains and awaken the latent abilities of the body which would enable you to earn the desired income. Make sure you understand that <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88:purushartha&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117" title="purushartha article link">Purushartha</a> is also essential and no amount of staring at Shree Yantra would suffice for it. Goddess Laxmi and Kubera won''t shower their blessings on you just cause you stare at the divine yantra. The yantra is for bringing out the hidden potentials of the body and the mind. The rest of it is Purushartha or hard work. But long story short this yantra does help bring out latent abilities thereby increasing your earnings.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h1 style="text-align: justify;">Chinese Bamboo</h1>\r\n<p><img class="pull-left" style="float: left;" title="chinese bamboo" src="images/chinese_bamboo.jpg" alt="chinese bamboo feng shui image" />&nbsp; &nbsp; When you buy this beautiful plant the feng shui expert is sure to tell you that if and when the bamboo grows your luck also grows. Oh Well... Most of you would have noticed your luck doesn''t grow. Another crazy theory associated with feng shui is if someone gifts you then only your luck grows. Well someone can gift you all the feng shui in the world and your luck still wouldn''t grow. &nbsp;It is the story associated with the bamboo and the message it puts across which makes your luck grow multi-fold. So here is the story. You can also see the video presentation of the story.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<div style="float: left;">&nbsp;</div>\r\n<p>&nbsp;A Chinese Farmer was poor and used to struggle to earn daily livelihood. In a hope that he can earn a fortune he decides to plant bamboo trees in his farm land so when they grow high and tall he can earn a fortune out of them. He plants little seeds of bamboo on his land and begins to water them daily. He is wise enough to plant other crops to feed his family on a daily basis. The other crops he plants apart from the bamboo seeds quickly begin to sprout and provide the day-to-day income for the farmer. But the bamboo seeds on whom he had high hopes and dreams do not show any signs of sprouting. A year goes by and still no growth inspite of daily watering and nurturing of those bamboo seeds. He starts to question himself and whether he had made some mistake, whether the seeds had died or rotted. But even with this huge dissappointment he continues to believe and water his plants. Second year goes by and the bamboo seeds still do not sprout. The neighbors of the farmer start to laugh at him for his failures yet he continues to water the bamboo seeds on daily basis. Three years go by and by now even the farmer starts to question himself. Yet out of habit or belief he continues watering the bamboo. Disappointment greets him daily as there is no sign of growth yet he still keeps watering the seeds inspite of the disappointment, anger and frustration. Even after four years of caring, watering and nurturing he gives in there is still no sign of growth in the bamboo seeds he planted. Yet out of instinct he continues watering the spots which has now become his habit. He couldn''t care about rewards anymore but there is hope deep down that one day his patience would bear fruit. Even after five years there is no growth whatsoever. The farmer is dejected and depressed. He is sure now that there is no life in those plants. Yet out of some strange habit he keeps on watering the plants. Finally one day the farmer jumps in joy, shouts at top of his lungs and runs back home. The neighbors believe the farmer has finally lost it. But to everyone''s surprise the farmer informs his family that his long and hard turmoil has finally bore fruit. The bamboo begin the sprout and in six weeks grow into a massive 90 feet tall strong bamboo tree. Five years of nothing and after that rags to riches in six weeks.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Moral of the Story: Whenever you invest in a future understand that it takes time and perseverence before the desired outcome is reached. But first you must plan to invest in the dream. Do not entirely rely on your dream to make your life good and always put in little of your time and finances into ensuring your day-to-day survival. There are always those who scrutinize failures but be sure to be firm in your faith and beliefs. There are always times when you feel down and dejected by not getting the desired outcome but even during those tough times continue with the belief that they would reap awards someday. Never give up on your dreams after a few failures. Beautiful message. Isn''t it?</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Oh!! But most of you already know this. Only thing that remains is the conviction and efforts to pursue those dreams. Astrology, Feng Shui and Sacred Yantras aren''t just some hocus pocus magic which make your life beautiful, lucky and easy. The beauty in your life comes through your own <a href="index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=87:prarabdha&amp;catid=19:main-articles&amp;Itemid=117" title="prarabdha article link">Prarabdha</a> and Purushartha. The only difference this items make is to inspire you and also to awaken your hidden talents. Astrology, Feng Shui and other lucky charms are not as bad as made out to be. Only problem is the astrologers, feng shui experts and other spiritual thugs who are hell bent on earning a fortune out of fooling people and not spreading the message across.

Most of the ancient literature on astrology never mentioned about Kaal Sarp yoga. Of course as a subject evolves and there is research done and a few new concepts are bound to rise up but certainly concepts like Kaal Sarp Yoga are hard to fathom. When you notice this yoga in your horoscope or get notified by an astrologer be sure to understand the surreal fear inserted into this yoga. When a person doesn''t get the desired success in life and he goes to an astrologer the astrologer probably checks for conditions like Vish Yoga, Kaal Sarpa Yoga, Planets in Dushamsthanas or Neecha Grahas in horoscope. If even one of them is present the astrologer is sure to make a moolah out of it. </p>\r\n<p>    To be accurate Rahu and Ketu are not planets according to Astronomy and even Astrology mentions them as Chayya Grahas or Shadow Planets. But since ancient texts do point to a demon called Rahu whose head got severed by Lord Vishnu we would do injustice to Rahu and Ketu if we do not consider them in Vedic Astrology. Having said that Kaal Sarp Yoga is hard to imagine to be true. Why? Cause two imaginary planets cannot hold your whole life to a ransom. I''ve come across quite a few people in life with Kaal Sarpa Yoga and most of them are to a point unsuccessful in life despite best efforts. But I''ve yet to come across any of Kaal Sarp Yoga natives whose condition is as adverse as people with Shrapit Yoga (Rahu-Shani in same sign) or Vish Yoga (Shani-Chandra in one sign) or benefics in Dushamsthanas. There are enough success stories associated with Kaal Sarpa Yogas like Jawaharlal Nehru, Margaret Thatcher, Paul Mccartney and Alfred Hitchcock among others to dispel the illusion of Kaal Sarpa Yoga.</p>\r\n<p>     One of the most important thing to note is Kaal Sarpa Yoga has all planets on one side of horoscope if Rahu is counted as lagna and Ketu as 7th house. What that means is there are less chances of aspects as most grahas cast a drishti on 7th house from themselves. There is a far greater chance of planets improving with time as long as there is no aspect involved. Long story short Kaal Sarp Yoga gives the best chance to improving a grahas condition in rashi as long as Shani or Rahu doesn''t aspect that house and if Rahu is not a co-tenant. If you look at the other articles on Kaal Sarpa Yoga they are sure to give you indications that conditions improve after certain time for Kaal Sarp Yoga natives. What they don''t tell you is conditions improve not due to Kaal Sarp Yoga but cause grahas mature and learn the art of co-existence if placed in same rashi, that grahas learn to turn adversity into opportunity and weakness into strengths with time. If Shani/Rahu''s aspect is present or Rahu as co-tenant is present then it is impossible for grahas to improve with time and the whole fault goes into the imaginary Kaal Sarp Yoga. </p>\r\n<p>     Those who are student of astrology should try looking at various horoscopes with or without Kaal Sarpa Yoga. If there is Rahu in co-existence with a particular graha or many grahas then none of them improve with time. In similar manner those with aspects by Shani and Rahu also don''t improve much with time. But those planets without aspect of Shani/Rahu and Rahu as co-tenant are sure to improve over time irrelevant of Kaap Sarp Yoga or any other yoga present in horoscope.
