<h3>History Of Astro Isha</h3>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astro Isha was founded on 2nd April 2014. It was formally registered as a Company on 30th September 2015 under Shop Establishment Act 1948 with Registration Number: PII/MJRG/2900050/0111946. 
Astro Isha was initially started in February 2013 under the name <strong>Jyotishi Vidya</strong>(www.jyotishividya.co.in) but was later changed to Astro Isha so as to avoid confusion with other websites bearing similar names.</p>
</div>
<h3>Purpose Of Astro Isha</h3>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astro Isha is a website for Astrologers and for Clients seeking expertise of those Astrologers. Astrologers and Astrology has its fair share of 
critiques and believers. Both are partially right in their judgement. Astrology like all subjects has its positives and negatives.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Goal of Astro Isha would be to separate the Astrological Part which is based on Reasoning, Logic, Probability, Statistics, Computation and Research which are purely Mathematical 
Fields from the Social Evils like Superstition, Fear and Paranoia. Astrology was founded on mathematical concepts like Probability and Stats which were gathered over a long period of time. But slowly but surely social evils like 
fear and superstition took over reasoning and logic part. Astro Isha is intended to filter the evils and try to show the logical and rational side of Astrology.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As mentioned in <strong>Brief Intro</strong> other purpose of Astro Isha would be to provide a medium which allows Astrologers and Clients to connect with each other.</p>
