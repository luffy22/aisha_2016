<p>&nbsp&nbsp;&nbsp;Astrologer who have opened <strong>Paid Account</strong> can receive Online Payments from customers. If a customer 
    decides to use your expertise then he can do so via <a href="<?php echo JURI::base() ?>ask-astrologer">Ask An Astrologer</a> page. Once the 
    customer orders your Services you have Ten Days(10 Days) to answer to his queries. Once the answer has been provided you 
would receive payment for your Consultation Services after deduction of some amount. If you fail to answer within ten days 
then the order would automatically be Cancelled and Customer would be Refunded the fees for Consultation.</p>
</div>
<h3>Charges, Taxes and Conversion Rates</h3>
<div>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Astro Isha charges 10% of the total charge meaning if your fees for online consultation is 30 $(US Dollars) then 3$(US Dollars) goes 
to Astro Isha as Commission over Consultation Fees. There is also Service Charges and Service Tax which are automatically deducted by 
Third-Party Gateways(CCAvenue For Indian Customers and Paypal For Rest Of World). In addition Paypal also applies 
Conversion Charges and Astro Isha has no say in those matters. Astrologers are advised to plan Fees for their Online Consultation after 
considering charges by Astro Isha, related Taxes, Payment Gateway charges and also Conversion Rates.</p>
